# üéµ Playlist Auto-DJ - Production Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (Production Version)

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd playlist-auto-dj

# Run the automated setup
python setup_production.py
```

### Step 2: Configure Spotify API
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app with these settings:
   - **App Name**: Playlist Auto-DJ
   - **App Description**: Personal music recommendation system
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080/callback`
3. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
# Option 1: Use the production runner (recommended)
python run_production.py

# Option 2: Run directly with Streamlit
streamlit run src/app/production_app.py
```

### Step 4: First-Time Usage
1. **Authenticate**: Click "Connect to Spotify" in the sidebar
2. **Load Data**: The app will automatically fetch your Spotify library
3. **Train Model**: Click "Train Your Personal Taste Model"
4. **Generate Playlists**: Use the Playlist Generator tab

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- **Your Liked Songs**: Positive examples for taste modeling
- **Your Playlists**: Additional preference data
- **Top Tracks**: Your most-played songs across different time periods
- **Audio Features**: Spotify's audio analysis for each track

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates 79+ features from 9 base audio features
- **Mood Classification**: Categorizes tracks into 6 moods (happy, sad, energetic, calm, focus, party)
- **Taste Modeling**: Trains personalized ML model (LightGBM or Random Forest)
- **Recommendation Engine**: Multi-criteria filtering with diversity optimization

### 3. Playlist Generation
- **Mood-Based Filtering**: Select target mood and audio characteristics
- **Preference Scoring**: Uses your trained taste model
- **Diversity Control**: Balance between similar and varied tracks
- **Real-Time Generation**: Creates playlists in seconds

## üéµ Spotify Integration Details

### Required Permissions
The app requests these Spotify scopes:
- `user-library-read`: Access your saved tracks
- `playlist-read-private`: Read your playlists
- `playlist-modify-public`: Create public playlists
- `playlist-modify-private`: Create private playlists
- `user-top-read`: Access your top tracks

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All ML training happens on your machine
- **No Data Sharing**: Your music data never leaves your computer
- **Spotify API**: Only standard API calls, no data storage on external servers
- **Cache Management**: Local caching for performance, can be cleared anytime

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Spotify credentials not found"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Make sure environment variables are set
echo $SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
echo $SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

# If empty, set them:
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

#### 2. "No training data available"
**Cause**: No liked songs or playlists found
**Solution**: 
- Like some songs on Spotify first
- Create playlists with your favorite tracks
- Use Spotify for a while to build listening history

#### 3. "LightGBM not available"
**Solution**: The app automatically falls back to Random Forest
```bash
# Optional: Install LightGBM for better performance
pip install lightgbm
```

#### 4. "Authentication failed"
**Solutions**:
- Check your Client ID and Secret are correct
- Ensure Redirect URI is set to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
- Try refreshing the browser page
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### 5. "Error loading data"
**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify Spotify API credentials
- Clear cache: Settings ‚Üí Clear Cache
- Restart the application

### Performance Tips

#### For Large Libraries (10K+ tracks)
- **Enable Caching**: Keeps processed data for faster loading
- **Batch Processing**: The app automatically handles large datasets
- **Memory Management**: Close other applications if needed

#### For Better Recommendations
- **More Training Data**: Like more songs, create diverse playlists
- **Regular Retraining**: Retrain model as your taste evolves
- **Feedback Loop**: Use generated playlists and like/dislike tracks
